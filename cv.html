            <p>
              I am a dynamic professional with a strong foundation in Strategic
              Management and proficient web development skills. My strategic
              mindset allows me to analyze complex business challenges and
              devise effective solutions. As a skilled and creative web
              developer, I excel in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and modern
              frameworks like React and Angular. I am passionate about creating
              visually appealing and user-friendly websites that align
              aesthetics with functionality.

              <br />
              <br />My unique combination of strategic acumen and web
              development expertise enables me to bridge the gap between
              business objectives and technology. I translate business
              requirements into digital solutions that drive growth, enhance
              user experiences, and achieve organizational goals. Adaptable and
              collaborative, I thrive in innovative environments, continuously
              staying updated on industry trends and emerging technologies.

              <br />
              <br />Currently seeking opportunities to leverage my Strategic
              Management background and web development prowess, I aim to
              contribute to meaningful projects and grow professionally in the
              dynamic realm of technology and business.
